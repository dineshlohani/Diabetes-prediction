       <p> Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management
          of the disease is crucial to prevent complications and improve health outcomes. This web application uses
          machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on certain risk factors.

       <p>The prediction algorithm used by this application is based on a dataset of individuals who have
           been diagnosed with diabetes, as well as a set of healthy individuals. The algorithm analyzes several
           risk factors, including age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and glucose levels, to predict
           the likelihood of diabetes.</p>

       <p>The accuracy of the diabetes prediction algorithm depends on the quality of the data used to
           train it, as well as the specific risk factors analyzed. In general, the accuracy of the
           prediction increases as more relevant risk factors are included in the analysis. However,
           it is important to note that no prediction algorithm is perfect, and there is always some
           level of uncertainty associated with the results.</p>

        <p>To use this system, simply navigate to the predict page(lets get started) and enter your information
            into the input fields. The algorithm will analyze your risk factors and provide a prediction
            of your likelihood of developing diabetes. It is important to note that the results provided by
            this application are for informational purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for
            medical advice or diagnosis.</p>
          <p>The value range of the input variables in a diabetes prediction system can vary depending on the specific dataset and the way the data is collected. However, typically the input variables have the following value ranges:

Pregnancy: 0 to 17,
Glucose: 0 to 200,
Blood Pressure: 0 to 122,
Skin Thickness: 0 to 99,
Insulin: 0 to 846,
BMI: 0 to 67,
Diabetes Pedigree Function: 0.078 to 2.42,
Age: 21 to 81.</p>
